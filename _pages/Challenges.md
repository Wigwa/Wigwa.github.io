# Challenges
Since I joined CyberShujaa, I've encountered a lot of challenges, not only based on the assignment but also in trying to juggle work and study at the same time. 
Despite the difficulty in all this am resilient and able to catch up with day-to-day activities.
The most overwhelming challenge that I've encountered recently is the TryHackMe assignment, but at the end of it, I managed to finish the assignment.

### The following are the assignments I had challenges with;
